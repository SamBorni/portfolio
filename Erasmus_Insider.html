                        <p><i>A little while ago, I was asked by the folks over at Erasmus to write a case study about my year in Sweden during the exchange program I was on last year. For other students who may be thinking about taking the same leap of faith I did, perhaps this will guide them in making the right choice. So, after spending one long bus journey creating it, I’ve just spent part of another editing it and what is written below is the finished product. Enjoy!</i></p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The start of something beautiful</h2>

                        <p>August 24th 2012 was the day I boarded a flight from London to Stockholm, venturing into the unknown. Never had I flown to a different country before without knowing someone at the other end waiting for me; let alone spent a year of my life in a land where English was not the native tongue. I was the only computing student from Portsmouth that took the opportunity to study abroad, and had heard nothing from anyone who had taken the same steps before me. Yet there I was, nervously entering the city limits in a taxi with several other students from all over the world embarking on the same journey as myself. Being in that car, coupled with the sight of the famous castle towering over the city centre put my mind at ease. I may have begun my journey alone but that solitude lasted for all of one morning, with some of the people I met along the way have becoming my closest friends. In the 10 months I was there, I can’t recall meeting a single Swede, or person for that matter, who was rude. Shy perhaps, but certainly not unpleasant to be around. The Swedish love to speak English (which their skills in are already impeccable) and the entire country was filled with picture perfect moments just waiting to be captured.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Be in the know</h2>

                        <p>Most importantly, as with travelling anywhere in Europe was knowing that I was covered when it came to health insurance, so wherever you decide to visit, be sure to send off for an EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) before departing! They’re free online and should there be any need to visit the hospital there’ll be no need to panic. You’ll already have your passport with you in order to get on the plane but take a driver’s license as well. Having the second form of ID really helped when opening a bank account, not to mention Sweden is very strict on the purchase of alcohol – so the more identification with which you can prove your age, the better. Also, considering here in Britain we have the best chocolate in the world, pack some. You’ll miss it when you’re there!</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Finding your way</h2>

                        <p>Getting there is simple enough thanks to airports all over the UK flying direct to Stockholm Arlanda, which is just a 15 minute train journey from Uppsala Centralstation (or 30 minutes by bus, which is cheaper!). The bus service in Uppsala (and everywhere else in Sweden for that matter) is fantastic as delays are non-existent, even when the snow outside is up to your knees. Upon arriving you’ll notice Uppsala is a cyclist’s heaven; bicycles line the streets all over town and you’ll definitely want to get your hands on one. Second hand bikes are perfectly reliable and can be purchased for as little as 300SEK (£30) if you’re lucky. Should you want to go travelling, the options are limitless – Scanbalt offer plenty of student-special deals with cruises to Estonia, Latvia and Russia (where the drinks are unbelievably cheap) as well as trips around the Arctic Circle. Or should you prefer to take charge yourself, some of the world’s greatest cities are less than a 2 hour flight away including Copenhagen, Berlin, Krakow, Prague and many more not to be missed.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Your home for the year</h2>

                        <p>Being a part of the Erasmus program guaranteed a place in University halls, and since finding private accommodation in Uppsala is difficult it was a definite perk. The best place to stay is undoubtedly Flogsta; it may look a little rough around the edges but it’s the biggest student accommodation in town and home to an important university tradition – the Flogsta scream! Be sure to check it out on YouTube and you’ll be joining in before you know it. The other university residences are also great, most containing en suite bathrooms. The only one to avoid would be Lilla Sunnersta. While in a beautiful spot by the lake, it’s also several miles out of town and considering the last bus to get there leaves the city centre at around 10pm, it can make getting home after a night out a pain. If you do end up going private for some reason, there isn’t really anywhere to avoid – the locals say Gottsunda is ‘the ghetto’ but it’s really not that bad. Generally just aim for the town centre, the closer the better. Don’t forget to attend all the welcome events when you arrive! It’s a great way to make new friends.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The studying part</h2>

                        <p>The location of your classes depends on the course you are enrolled in. There are lots of university buildings right in the centre of town, so meeting up with friends for lunch or to ‘fika’ (I’ll come back to that in a bit) at a student ‘nation’ (that too) is a very simple task. Any other classes take place only a 10 minute bus or bike journey from Stora Torget (the main square in the middle of the city). The Erasmus coordinators at the university are very friendly and willing to help whenever they can so just shoot them an email with any questions you may have. Class sizes aren’t too big and the quality of teaching is fantastic, plus there’s no need to worry about the language barrier. While some courses are exclusively Swedish, many are taught in English so you’ll have no problem in lectures or asking for help if you need it. Be sure to enrol in a Swedish language class though! While everyone may speak great English, that doesn’t help when you’re shopping at the local supermarket. The basic language skills will take you a long way, plus it’s a lot of fun to do with other international students.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Student nations and the all-important fika</h2>

                        <p>Fika. It is a word heard in conversation several times a day in every part of town. It is both a noun and a verb. It is part of the Swedish way of life. It’s nothing complex, it is simply taking a portion of your day, big or small, usually in the mid afternoon to sit with friends and consume coffee and cake. Everybody does it at some point and there are many great places in Uppsala to do so. Top pick would have to be ‘Storken’, a fantastic little café in the city centre which is a student favourite. Or you could go for lunch at your student nation! The nations are a huge part of Uppsala student life. Think of them as your student union at home, except Uppsala has 13 in total. During the day they are a great place to meet friends, have lunch, study or just relax but at night many of them become clubs; some of which are the best in Uppsala. You have to join at least one (and different nations offer different membership perks) but your student card will get you into any of them.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">A whole lot more</h2>

                        <p>There’s plenty that I couldn’t fit into the first few paragraphs of this guide, and there’s a whole lot more I won’t be able to fit into this section either. Student life in Uppsala is unrivalled because it is the student town. No matter your taste in music, there’ll be a student night for you. There are fantastic bars to watch live sport, both at the nations and elsewhere. There are affordable restaurants, as well as some more lavish ones if you want to treat yourself (fully endorsing ‘Peppar Peppar’ here, the food is fantastic!). Take a day trip to Stockholm or a weekend trip to Gothenburg. Head up to Lapland, do some dog sledding and give yourself a great opportunity to see the northern lights. Don’t worry if you don’t fancy the 16 hour trip, you might get lucky and see them from the roof of your accommodation. The bonuses of life in Uppsala are endless.</p>

                        <p>A little closer to home lie the castle and the cathedral – they’re centuries old and both right in the city centre. Head down to Gamla Uppsala and visit the Viking burial mounds. Rent a cabin by the lake, split the costs between several people and it’s around 50SEK (£5) per person per night. It’ll provide some of the most memorable sights you’ll ever see. Go for a walk through the forest in the winter, take a sled and find the biggest hill you can. The snow in Uppsala can last for months (and gets cold along with it, so wrap up warm), providing endless fun. Don’t forget the champagne party during Valborg to celebrate the start of summer either!</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Stretching those student loans</h2>

                        <p>Set up a Swedish bank account! It will save you money because using your English credit/debit card will probably rack up extra charges, plus everywhere in Sweden prefers card payments. Cash payments are sometimes not even an option (perhaps most noticeably on buses). While accommodation in Uppsala is cheap, especially if you’re in the University halls where bills are included, general living can be expensive. Alcohol costs a pretty penny, especially if you spend a night exploring the bars of Uppsala which aren’t exclusively for students. Supermarkets aren’t too costly but you can still find yourself dropping a lot cash on the essentials – even more for the niceties like fresh meat and junk food. The best way to save cash though is to eat and drink with friends! Buying more and splitting the cost will ALWAYS save you money in the long run.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Perhaps, most importantly…</h2>

                        <p>Speak to anyone and everyone. Make as many friends as you can and get involved in everything around you. I have made friends for life from every corner of the world, and I couldn’t have asked for better companions to spend my time with. When the cold hits you outside for the first time (it can potentially drop to -25c), you’ll shiver, curse and moan but you’ll love how beautiful the snow makes your surroundings. Go and explore the city and its outskirts; discover the things that will make it a place you’ll remember for the rest of your life. I spent ten months in Uppsala and it was undoubtedly the best ten months of mine.</p>
